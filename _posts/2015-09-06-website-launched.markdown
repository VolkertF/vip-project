Looks like our website is up and running! If it isn't, then you shouldn't be seeing this.

We decided to go with <a href="//jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> for our web needs since it's easy to use and can be hosted on <a href="//pages.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> for free. As a college student, easy and free is perfect for me. There are also a lot of attractive themes that you can easily use with Jekyll. I found this nice clean theme at <a href="//jekyllthemes.org/themes/pithy/" target="_blank">Jekyll Themes</a>.

I'm excited to be working with other awesome CS students from across the world on this project and hope (when it's finished) that you enjoy using the result of our hard work!
