<p>VIP is a collaboration between students from <a href="//hs-hannover.de/start/index.html" target="_blank">Hochschule Hannover</a> and <a href="//gvsu.edu" target="_blank">Grand Valley State University</a>. We are a diverse group of students working together to create something exciting and useful. We are <a href="#fabian">Fabian</a>, <a href="#cyril">Cyril</a>, <a href="#alex">Alex</a>, and <a href="#johannes">Johannes</a>.</p>

	<p class="team-icebreaker">Hi, my name is Fabian!</p><p>I am in my seventh semester of applied computer science, where the first two were spent at the university of Hanover.I am, at this time, counting 21 years and came up with the initial idea behind VIP.</p><p>In my free time I consider myself a passionate gamer,movie watcher, and music listener, although I also really enjoy reading books,composing music and drawing, when I find time to do so. I go couple dancing on a regular basis and spend a lot of time volunteering as an EMT(Emergency Medical Technician) and group leader at the civil protection of the German Red Cross.</p><p>Technical spoken I   have been working with C, C++, Java, Assembly, SQL so far and was appointed as a project leader two times in projects I worked on earlier in my study. I am not to fond of the idea of working on databases, as I understand the need for them, but don't really enjoy working on them. On the other side I am eager to learn more about managing a project in general and implementing the controls for the user to interact with the application.</p>

	<p class="team-icebreaker">I'm a super-senior computer science student at Grand Valley State University. I'm originally from Yonkers, New York but I now live in Grand Rapids, Michigan. I enjoy studying and analyzing algorithms and producing readable documentation. I'm not very skilled with front-end design but I hope to get better with practice. Outside of programming, I like travelling, reading, and learning new musical instruments.</p>

	<p class="team-icebreaker">I'm a super senior in my last semester as a Computer Science major. I just spent the summer at Auto Owners Insurance and should be returning in December.  I'm much more experienced in back-end development but I look forward to expanding my front-end knowledge. I'm also much better with low-level algorithms than high-level design. I enjoy playing Magic the Gathering and Super Smash Brothers Melee in my free time.  I also love movies and TV.</p>

	<p class="team-icebreaker">My name is Johannes.</p><p>I am studying applied computer science in the fifth semester at the Hochschule Hannover and am 19 years old.</p><p>During my sparetime, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, coding, and playing the piano and the drums. For earning some extra money, i tutor pupils in math and science at a tutoring center called Schuelerhilfe e.V.</p><p>I can work with Java very well, and I am familiar with C, C++, Assembly and Pascal, too. Analysing and understanding the logic behind programs and creating solutions for logical problems is one of my strengths.
